# CryptographyDotNET
These are just a bunch of small C# programs which essentially serve as templates for implementing cryptography in your .NET applications. 
These programs use WinForms, but you could easily repurpose them for WPF, MAUI, or even as a console application.
Please see https://youtu.be/2r63nROkqEg for a full in-depth guide of how these actually work. The "repos.zip" file contains all the direcories zipped together for your convenience.
